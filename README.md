# GraphKL framework - GraphQL Kafka Language

Powerfull and simple streaming framework into a intuitive Graphql enviroment for Apache Kafka out-of-the-box applications. 

GraphKL goes beyond GraphQl and beyond Apache Kafka, providing simple solution to read, write, and process streaming data in real-time, at scale, using the powerfull GraphQL-like semantics, with dynamic query, mutations, subcriptions, and fragmented queries.

It offers an easy way to express stream processing transformations as an alternative to writing an application in a programming language such as Java or Python.

Currently available as a developer preview, GraphKL provides powerful stream processing capabilities such as joins, aggregations, event-time windowing, and more!

## Quickstart

Download the repo:
$ git clone https://github.com/scigility/kafka-graphql.git

Edit the docker-compose.yml file to set your ip into kafka advertiser properties in the Docker:
KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME
KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS

Then run the kafka and zookeeper:
docker-compose up

After this, build the application:
mvn clean package

Now you a ready to run the application:
java -jar target/graphql-spring-boot-starter-sample-1.0.3-alpha.jar


You have access to the graphql interface via http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql

mutation updateKafkaMutation {
  updateKafka(input: {
		broker: "192.168.171.135:9092"
		zookeeper: "192.168.171.135:2181"
	}) {broker,zookeeper topics{name}}
}

query {
	 kafka{broker,zookeeper, topics{name}}
}

mutation addKafkaTopicMutation {
  addKafkaTopic(input: {
		topic_name: "test"
	})

	{topics{name}}
}

query {
	topics{
		name
	}
}

mutation produceRecord {
  produceTopicRecord(input: {name: "test", message: "howdy graphql"}) {
    key
    value
    offset
    partition
  }
}


mutation consumeRecord {
  consumeTopicRecord(input: {name: "test"}) {
    key
    value
    offset
    partition
  }
}

mutation startStream {
  streamStart(input: {input:"in" output:"out"}) {
		key
		value
  }
}

query {
	stream{
		key value
	}
}
